Complete the script:

1. Receive a request from the client
2. Parse the request and verify that it is a read request
3. Send the data blocks to the client one by one waiting for an acknowledgement after each data message
4. Donâ€™t forget to handle error messages as well as acknowledgements for blocks that need to be 
retransmitted.
5. Close the socket after successfully receiving an acknowledgement for the last block
6. Cleanly exit the program

For this lab you will be writing the Python code for a TFTP server.

- TFTP uses User Datagram Protocol (UDP) as the transport layer, so you will need to use a DGRAM socket in 
your Python code.
- Your TFTP server must send and receive data on port 69.
- While TFTP supports both read and write requests, your TFTP server must only support read (GET) requests 
(see extra credit below for write requests)

The TFTP RFC defines 5 messages used by TFTP.

1. Read Request
2. Write Request
3. Data Message
4. Acknowledgement Message
5. Error Message

The first message that the server receives is a request (either a read or a write). Your server will only have 
to support read requests. The RFC defines a request as follows:

           2 bytes     string    1 byte     string   1 byte
            ------------------------------------------------
           | Opcode |  Filename  |   0  |    Mode    |   0  |
            ------------------------------------------------

Data blocks are sent to the client one at a time using a data message which is formatted as follows:

                   2 bytes     2 bytes      n bytes
                   ----------------------------------
                  | Opcode |   Block #  |   Data     |
                   ----------------------------------

Once the server sends the first data block to the client, it must wait for an acknowledgement. An acknowledgement 
is sent from the client using the following message format:

                         2 bytes     2 bytes
                         ---------------------
                        | Opcode |   Block #  |
                         ---------------------

Here is the format for an error message:

               2 bytes     2 bytes      string    1 byte
               -----------------------------------------
              | Opcode |  ErrorCode |   ErrMsg   |   0  |
               -----------------------------------------

The TFTP RFC defines a set of error codes and what they mean:

   Value     Meaning
   0         Not defined, see error message (if any).
   1         File not found.
   2         Access violation.
   3         Disk full or allocation exceeded.
   4         Illegal TFTP operation.
   5         Unknown transfer ID.
   6         File already exists.
   7         No such user.

There could be situations where the client sends an error to the server. If your script receives an error message 
from the client, print out the error code, print the error message, and quit.
